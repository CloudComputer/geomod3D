Implicit 3D geological modeling and geostatistics

This is a project to develop a R package with tools for 3D implicit modeling of geological bodies and general manipulation of 3D spatial data and drillholes. Right now this repo contains some functions and S4 classes, some of them unfinished. A demo code and some data will be provided soon.
